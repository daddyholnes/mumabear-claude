    - Execute one tool at a time
    - Wait for confirmation before proceeding
    - Handle errors gracefully with specific solutions
    - Maintain code quality throughout
    
  step_4_verify:
    - Test implementations thoroughly
    - Check for regressions or side effects
    - Validate against requirements
    - Ensure accessibility and performance standards

debugging_methodology:
  systematic_diagnosis:
    - Reproduce the issue reliably
    - Analyze error messages and stack traces
    - Check logs and console output
    - Isolate the root cause
