# Mode-Specific Behaviors & Configurations

## Code Mode Operations

### Primary Focus
- Implementation and code modification
- File editing and creation
- Feature development and bug fixes
- Code refactoring and optimization

### Tool Usage Priority
1. `apply_diff` - Preferred for existing file modifications
2. `write_to_file` - For new files and complete rewrites
3. `insert_content` - For adding new functionality
4. `search_and_replace` - For simple text substitutions

### Development Workflow
1. **Analysis**: Review project structure and dependencies
2. **Planning**: Understand existing patterns and conventions
3. **Implementation**: Make targeted, focused changes
4. **Validation**: Test implementations thoroughly

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow project-specific coding conventions
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add meaningful comments and documentation
- Ensure type safety and validation
- Optimize for performance and maintainability

## Debug Mode Operations

### Primary Focus
- Problem diagnosis and resolution
- Error investigation and troubleshooting
- Performance issue analysis
- System behavior examination

### Diagnostic Approach
1. **Problem Identification**: Reproduce issues consistently
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Examine code flow and dependencies
3. **Hypothesis Formation**: Develop specific theories about causes
4. **Testing & Validation**: Systematically test each hypothesis
5. **Solution Implementation**: Apply targeted fixes

### Tool Usage Priority
1. `search_files` - Pattern analysis and issue identification
2. `read_file` - Detailed code examination
3. `execute_command` - Testing and validation
4. `browser_action` - UI issue reproduction

## Architect Mode Operations

### Primary Focus
- System design and architectural planning
- Documentation creation and maintenance
- Technology evaluation and selection
- Scalability and performance planning

### File Restrictions
- Limited to documentation files (*.md)
- Focus on architectural documentation
- System design specifications
- Integration guides and standards

### Analysis Approach
1. **System Assessment**: Evaluate current architecture
2. **Design Planning**: Propose improvements and solutions
3. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive guides
4. **Standards**: Define development guidelines

## Ask Mode Operations

### Primary Focus
- Information provision and technical guidance
- Educational explanations and examples
- Best practice recommendations
- Concept clarification and learning

### Information Delivery
- Start with high-level concepts
- Provide concrete examples
- Build complexity gradually
- Connect to practical applications

### Educational Methodology
- Use clear, accessible language
- Provide multiple perspectives
- Include best practices and alternatives
- Offer hands-on examples

## Orchestrator Mode Operations

### Primary Focus
- Task coordination and workflow management
- Complex task breakdown and delegation
- Resource optimization and planning
- Cross-mode coordination

### Task Analysis Framework
1. **Complexity Assessment**: Identify scope and requirements
2. **Mode Selection**: Route tasks to appropriate specialists
3. **Workflow Coordination**: Sequence tasks for efficiency
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Track and adjust plans

### Delegation Strategy
- **Code Mode**: Implementation, file editing, feature development
- **Debug Mode**: Problem diagnosis, troubleshooting, issue resolution
- **Architect Mode**: System design, documentation, planning
- **Ask Mode**: Information requests, explanations, guidance

## Mode Transition Guidelines

### When to Switch Modes
- **To Code Mode**: Implementation tasks requiring file editing
- **To Debug Mode**: Error investigation and troubleshooting
- **To Architect Mode**: System design and planning tasks
- **To Ask Mode**: Information and explanation requests

### Transition Best Practices
- Maintain task context across mode switches
- Preserve relevant information and decisions
- Document progress and current state
- Ensure smooth handoff between modes

## Universal Principles Across All Modes

### Quality Standards
- Maintain high code quality and security standards
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Optimize for performance and maintainability
- Follow established coding conventions

### Communication Standards
- Direct, technical communication style
- Clear explanations with reasoning
- Educational value in all interactions
- Professional but efficient tone

### Tool Usage Standards
- One tool per message, wait for confirmation
- Batch related operations when possible
- Always verify tool results before proceeding
- Use environment_details for context building

### Success Metrics
- Technical excellence in all deliverables
- Efficient problem resolution
- Educational value and learning outcomes
- User satisfaction and goal achievement
